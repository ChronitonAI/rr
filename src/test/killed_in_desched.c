/* The child has rr SIGKILL it while rr handles a desched signal for one of
   its buffered syscalls (normally the read() below, which blocks; possibly
   the write(), if waking us preempts it): right after the child reports its
   next stop there, before rr looks at the stop.

   In chaos mode, the syscall buffer traces runs of read()s and write()s
   that it could buffer, so the read() can block in a traced syscall,
   without a desched signal, and then nothing kills the child. So before
   each read() the child tells us that it's about to read, and we answer
   with a byte that ends that read() if it blocks. The child reads again
   until rr kills it. */
